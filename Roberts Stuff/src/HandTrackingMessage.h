//! you don't need.  In particular, if you are using the raw pose layer
//! (i.e., \ref HandTrackingClient::PoseMessage), you should consider ignoring all gesture-related

//! \brief Messages relating to simultaneous or individual pinching.
//!
//! Bimanual pinch messages are a ``higher-level'' message than the regular
//! pinch message, and can be used to distinguish whether one hand pinched
//! or whether both pinched simultaneously.  If the user presses both hands
//! at the same time, for example, you will only get a single Bimanual
//! SIMULTANEOUSLY_PRESSED message (instead of two PRESSED messages, as you
//! would with the PinchMessage). The cost
//! of this higher-level knowledge is a bit of additional lag: to determine
//! whether two pinches happen at the same time we have to wait 100ms or so 
//! (since the pinches are never going to be _exactly_ simultaneous).  You 
//! can decide whether the added functionality is worth the lag and choose which
//! of the two interfaces you prefer.  
//!
//! Note that we do not recommend responding to both the BimanualPinchMessage
//! and the \ref PinchMessage; applications should generally
//! pick one or the other.  Responding to both can lead to very 
//! confusing interactions (since most pinches will be detected at least
//! twice).  
//! 
//! To help understanding the difference between the PinchMessage and the
//! BimanualPinchMessage, consider the following two scenarios:
//!
//! First, suppose the user presses her left hand and then, a second later,
//! her right hand.  You will receive the following sequence of events:
//!
//!    \li PinchMessage(PRESSED, left hand)
//!    \li ...
//!    \li BimanualPinchMessage(INDIVIDUALLY_PRESSED, left hand)
//!    \li ...
//!    \li PinchMessage(PRESSED, right hand)
//!    \li ...
//!    \li BimanualPinchMessage(INDIVIDUALLY_PRESSED, right hand)
//!
//! Note how the BimanualPinchMessage always lags slightly behind the 
//! PinchMessage (you will receive it a couple frames later).  
//! Now, suppose the user presses her left and right hands simultaneously.
//!
//!    \li PinchMessage(PRESSED, left hand)
//!    \li PinchMessage(PRESSED, right hand)
//!    \li BimanualPinchMessage(SIMULTANEOUSLY_PRESSED, both hands)
//! In the case of the double pinch, it can be reported immediately.
