//! \brief A class representing the intrinsic/extrinsic parameters of the depth camera.
//! 
//! Our camera model is identical to the one used in OpenCV
//! (and in OpenNI).  A full description can be found here:
//! http://docs.opencv.org/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html
//!
//! The extrinsic matrix is set up such that world space corresponds
//! to the desk frame used in hand tracking, with y pointing up and 
//! z pointing toward the user.  
//!
//! Everything here will be in double precision, because this is
//! necessary for dealing robustly with distortion (some distortion
//! terms use the 6th power of the radius, which would cause precision
//! loss when working with 32-bit floats).  
//!
//! One possible gotcha: in OpenCV camera space, the coordinate system has the positive z
//! vector pointing into the frame and the positive y vector pointing
//! down from the top of the image.  Note that this is flipped
//! from OpenGL (where the _negative_ z vector points into the frame).  
//!
//! This class includes the \ref worldToCamera and \ref cameraToImage functions
//! for projecting a world space point down to the image plane.  Because inverting
//! camera distortion is considerably complicated, the inverses of 
//! these functions are not provided.  If you need undistortion functionality, 
//! you can find it within OpenCV; take a look at the 
//! <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/modules/imgproc/doc/geometric_transformations.html#undistortpoints">undistortPoints</a> function.
