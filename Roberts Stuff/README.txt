Requires 3Gears SDK installed and nimble_server running (nimble_server.bat in NimbleSDK install folder).

TrackTest.exe is a very simple example of the get functions in Track.h being used. 

Not currently in library form but should work fine if included in another project. Comments in Track.h give further detail about how it works.
